# Example: Tweets downloader by hashtag

For every hashtag ("sports" and "weather") it downloads 100 tweets. Feel free to change the code to suit your needs.
Optionally you can specify the list of hashtags as arguments when calling the script, as shown in the following example:

````
$ python scraper-by-tag.py music art science
````
