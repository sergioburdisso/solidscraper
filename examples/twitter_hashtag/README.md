# Example: Tweets downloader by hashtag

For every hashtag ("sports" and "weather") it downloads 100 tweets. Feel free to change the code to suite your needs.
Optionally you can give a list of hashtag as arguments when calling the script, as shown in the following example:

````
$ python scraper-by-tag.py music art science
````
